There's a cure for zombies.\r\n\r\nImagine, what if the cure exists? What if zombies plague can be stoped?\r\nExplore old, abandoned graveyard, heal as many zombies as you can, and find your way out.\r\nBut be careful not to become one of them!\r\n\r\nWe present you our first HTML5 game. Play it anywhere and anyhow you want.\r\nWe also support latest mobile devices!\r\n\r\n## How we use game jam \"change\" theme?\r\n\r\nIn our game zombies plague can be stoped, so you don't kill them, but heal them and \"change\" back to humans.\r\nTurned humans need to be protected, as they can \"change\" back to zombies after being beaten.\r\n\r\nOur protagonist also doesn't die, but \"changes\" to zombie. You have even oportunity to play him in zombie form.\r\n\r\n## Team\r\n\r\n-   [Kris Urbas](https://twitter.com/krzysu) - programming, story\r\n- \t[Pawel Madeja](https://twitter.com/pawelmadeja) - graphics\r\n\r\n![Heal'em All.
